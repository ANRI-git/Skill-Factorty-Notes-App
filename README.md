# *Skill Factory* Bootcamp
Welcome to my GitHub repository for *Avalith's bootcamp* named **Skill Factory** divided in two courses, one for React and other for Node. Here you will find my very first projects made in React and Node.js.
## *Notes App* page
Fourth *Front-end* project made in **React** and **Node.js**.
It's a page to create and save notes. Here you can create your personal notes, to-do lists and add some images to them. It's hosted in Firebase, so it only has the front-end part coded since it is a React-only project.
